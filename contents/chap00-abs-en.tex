As the economy develops and travel demand grows, the number of motorcycles rises due to their convenience. Yet, traffic accidents involving motorcycles have increased, driven by tougher traffic management and insufficient safety awareness among some riders. Helmet use significantly impacts accident outcomes for riders. This paper designs and implements a real - time helmet - wearing detection system for motorcycle riders, visualizing results. Its key tasks are detection model training and system development.

In terms of model training, a dual model collaborative architecture was constructed based on the YOLO object recognition algorithm. The first model focuses on quickly and accurately identifying the overall helmet wearing status of motorcycles and their occupants in images or videos; The second model uses the key areas output by the previous model as input to accurately locate and recognize the driver's ID. During the research process, a comprehensive comparative analysis was conducted on the training effects of three different scale models, YOLOv11n, YOLOv11s, and YOLOv11m, and the detection scenarios applicable to each model were summarized.

In terms of system development, a front-end and back-end separated system is developed based on the browser/server (B/S) architecture, using Vue framework to build B-end pages and SpringBoot framework to build S-end servers. The front-end offers two core functions: helmet wearing detection, allowing users to customize model, IoU, and confidence, and view/save results; and historical record query, enabling searches by specific conditions and using visual charts for analysis. The backend has two modules: the object detection module calls the model for user-uploaded media detection and stores results, while the record query module fetches historical data from the database based on user filters and returns them.
