As the economy develops and travel demand grows, the number of motorcycles rises due to their convenience. Yet, with tougher traffic management and some drivers' low safety awareness, motorcycle-related accidents are increasing. Helmet use directly impacts accident casualties. This paper designs and implements a real-time helmet-wearing detection system for motorcycle riders, visualizing detection results. Its main work covers training the detection model and developing the system.

In terms of detection model training, based on the Yolo target recognition algorithm, a dual model collaborative architecture is constructed: first, it focuses on rapid recognition of the overall helmet wearing status of motorcycles and their riders in images or videos; Second, the key area of the former output is the input, which can accurately locate and identify the driver ID. in the process of research, the training effects of three different scale models, yoov11n, yoov11s and yoov11m, are systematically analyzed, and the applicable detection scenarios of different models are summarized.

In terms of system development, the front and back-end separation system is developed based on Browser/server (b/s) architecture. The Vue framework is used to build the b-end page, and the springboot framework is used to build the S-end server. The front-end browser provides users with two functions: helmet wearing detection and history query. The helmet wearing detection function allows users to customize the detection model, IOU and confidence, and supports browsing and saving the detection results. The history query function supports users' filtering of query fields and data visualization. The back-end server is divided into two modules: target detection and record query, which are respectively used to connect the two functions of the front-end. The target detection module receives the data input by the user, calls the model for detection, and finally returns the detection results. The record query module queries the history records in the database according to the filter conditions entered by the user and returns them.
