With the increasing number of motorcycles, motorcycle traffic accidents occur frequently. Whether the helmet is worn or not is directly related to the degree of casualties of drivers and passengers in the accident. The purpose of this system is to design and implement a helmet wearing detection system for motorcycle drivers and passengers, which can detect the helmet wearing status of drivers and passengers in real time, visualize the detection results, reduce manual intervention, and improve law enforcement efficiency.

At the core algorithm level, the system builds a dual model collaborative architecture based on the Yolo target recognition algorithm: first, it focuses on quickly identifying the overall helmet wearing status of motorcycles and their riders in images or videos; Second, the key area of the former output is the input, which can accurately locate and identify the driver's identity. In the research process, the training effects of different weight models such as yolov11n and yolov11s were systematically compared and analyzed. Through continuous optimization of parameters, the accuracy and stability of helmet detection were improved.

In the system design, springboot is used to build the back-end server, Vue is used to build the front-end web page, which supports users to independently select the model, and adjust the intersection union ratio (IOU) and confidence as needed to achieve personalized target detection. The historical detection results can be visually presented through a variety of visual charts such as pie charts and histogram charts, providing clear and convenient data analysis means for traffic management departments, and effectively helping to improve law enforcement efficiency and traffic safety management level.
